# Botanix Brain

Botanix Brain is an innovative project that addresses challenges faced by farmers and gardeners through a combination of hardware and software solutions. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as AI, ML, and data science, this project aims to guide users in selecting the most suitable plants for their specific location.

## Project Overview

The system employs a blend of soil and climate sensors to gather environmental data, including soil pH, temperature, humidity, sunlight exposure, and moisture levels. Using AI/ML algorithms, the software analyzes this data and compares it with an extensive database of information on various fruits and plants.

## Key Features

1. **Intelligent Recommendations:** The system provides personalized plant recommendations based on thorough analysis, considering factors crucial for plant growth.
2. **Informative Dashboard:** A user-friendly dashboard assists users in interpreting data received from sensors and facilitates predictions through an interactive UI.
3. **Accurate Dataset:** A meticulously crafted dataset of over 1500 records, created under the guidance of agricultural experts, ensures accurate predictions and reliable recommendations.

## Hardware and Software

- **Hardware:** Arduino, Soil and climate sensors (Sunlight, Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality)
- **Software:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Tkinter, Matplotlib, Custom Tkinter

## Environmental Impact

The project focuses on promoting environmental sustainability by suggesting plant varieties best suited to the local environment. This approach reduces the need for fertilizers and pesticides, contributing to waste reduction.
