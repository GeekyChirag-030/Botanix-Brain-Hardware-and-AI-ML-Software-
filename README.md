    <h1>Botanix Brain</h1>

    <p>Botanix Brain is an innovative project that addresses challenges faced by farmers and gardeners through a combination of hardware and software solutions. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as AI, ML, and data science, this project aims to guide users in selecting the most suitable plants for their specific location.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>The system employs a blend of soil and climate sensors to gather environmental data, including soil pH, temperature, humidity, sunlight exposure, and moisture levels. Using AI/ML algorithms, the software analyzes this data and compares it with an extensive database of information on various fruits and plants.</p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Intelligent Recommendations:</strong> The system provides personalized plant recommendations based on thorough analysis, considering factors crucial for plant growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Informative Dashboard:</strong> A user-friendly dashboard assists users in interpreting data received from sensors and facilitates predictions through an interactive UI.</li>
        <li><strong>Accurate Dataset:</strong> A meticulously crafted dataset of over 1500 records, created under the guidance of agricultural experts, ensures accurate predictions and reliable recommendations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Hardware and Software</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Arduino, Soil and climate sensors (Sunlight, Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality)</li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Tkinter, Matplotlib, Custom Tkinter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>

    <p>The project focuses on promoting environmental sustainability by suggesting plant varieties best suited to the local environment. This approach reduces the need for fertilizers and pesticides, contributing to waste reduction.</p>
